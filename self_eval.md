# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
**Pretty solid! A few questions still but I'm going to work through them.**
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
**Much more solid than I did earlier today, researching with outside materials was extremely helpful today.**
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
**I wonder how to chain methods together, and how high up you can build methods on top of each other, if that makes sense?**
